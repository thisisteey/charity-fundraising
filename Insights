ANALYSIS INSIGHTS
To solve the business problem, the following datasets were presented to me EFO_Donation_Data and EFO_Donor_Data. SQLite Database Management System was used to query and analyse the datasets. Also, Tableau was used to visually represent the analysed data.
The data in the datasets includes the following:
EFO_Donation_Data:
• id
