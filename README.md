I will be working hypothetically as a data analyst for a charity known as EDUCATION FOR ALL. The Head of Fundraising has requested I give statistical analysis on donor insights and donation rates. Along with the fundraising team, I aim to do the following:
• Increase the number of donors in our database.
• Increase the frequency of donors’ donations.
• Raise the donation value in our database.
In two weeks, I need to share my insights from the donation data with the fundraising team and share my fundraising plan to boost donations for the following year.
The data sets EFO_Donation_Data and EFO_Donor_Data were used to solve the business problem. I analysed the data using the following SQL commands:
• JOIN
• WHERE
• ON
• ORDER BY ()
• BETWEEN
• AND
• LEFT JOIN
• OR
• GROUP BY ()
• HAVING
• LIMIT
• DESC
• ASC
• SUM()
• COUNT ()
• MAX()
• MIN()
• AVG()
• ROUND ()
In addition, I used root cause analysis to comprehend the problem and run pertinent queries. As a result of this, I have obtained vital insights from the offered datasets, created visualisations, and compiled a report for the team.
